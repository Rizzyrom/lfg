# LFG App Feedback Tracker

Automatically collected from chat messages when users mention bugs, issues, features, or suggestions.

## How it works

When users chat and mention keywords like:
- **Bugs**: "bug", "issue", "broken", "not working", "error"
- **Features**: "feature", "add", "want", "need", "should"
- **General**: "fix", "improve", "suggestion"

The system automatically logs them here with timestamps and categories.
